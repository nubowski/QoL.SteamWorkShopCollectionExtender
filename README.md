2. Open your browser's developer console (press F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I)
3. Copy and paste the entire script from `WorkShopExtender.js` into the console and press Enter. Or drug'n'drop it on the console field.
4. Run it (by pressing Enter) and you will see two new buttons on the collection management page: a "✓" button to add all items and a "⚠" button to remove all items.
